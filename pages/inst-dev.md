excerpt: The Instructor Development Committee helps new and established Instructors.
---

The Instructor Development Committee (formerly known as the **Mentoring Subcommittee**) supports Instructors as they progress 
through training, teaching, curriculum development,
and other community-related activities. They help promote community-building and networking, by 
providing virtual spaces where instructors from all over the world can share teaching success stories and 
discuss teaching strategies. For more about our work, see our [onboarding document](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/mentoring/discussion_session.html).

**_Our Goal:_**    
To support Instructors in our community through a range of activities. 

**_Our Approach:_**    
We run regular [instructor discussion sessions](https://pad.carpentries.org/instructor-discussion) where people preparing to teach can ask for advice. People who have recently taught can use the sessions to debrief.

**_Our Structure:_**    
The Committee has monthly meetings, which are open to new members. Meetings are scheduled, organised, and 
run through this [etherpad](https://pad.carpentries.org/scf-mentoring).
For more about committee roles, see the [Handbook](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/mentoring/mentoring-subcommittee-roles.html#discussion-session-coordinators). We also organise information about our work though this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/carpentries/mentoring).

**_Our Leadership:_**    
There are two co-Chairs. Toby Hodges is one of the current co-Chairs. The other co-Chair position is vacant.
In addition, a Carpentries staff member is part of the committee as a staff liaison.

title: Community Service Awards
excerpt: The Carpentries values the contributions of its volunteers and seeks to recognize outstanding effort 
---

The Carpentries relies on volunteer efforts to
achieve many of its goals. Its Community Service Awards are a way for
its Executive Council to recognise work which, in its opinion,
significantly improves the fulfillment of The Carpentries' mission and
benefits the broader community. The intention of these awards is to
demonstrate that service to our community does lead to recognition and
reward, rather than to provide a direct incentive to contributors.

### Recognition

Recognition will take the form of an award certificate plus a public
announcement.  The outgoing Executive Council will normally make up
to two awards during the last three months of its term, although in
exceptional circumstances the Executive Council may choose to make
awards at other times, or to make more than two awards within a single
year.

### Proposing an Award

Any Carpentries community member is entitled to propose an award at any time, stating
the reasons for which the award is merited.  Recipients need not be
members of The Carpentries community (though receiving an award may be an indication that
consideration for membership is appropriate).  While a single
individual will normally not receive multiple awards, this may
occasionally be done to acknowledge ongoing contributions.

Awards will be considered in the order in which they are received.  In
the event that more than one award is proposed in a given period, the
Executive Council may elect to hold over a proposal.

Proposals should be made confidentially to the Board by sending email to
[nominations@carpentries.org](mailto:nominations@carpentries.org).
The nomination must include:

*   the name of the person being nominated
*   a short explanation of what they have contributed
    and how it has helped the community
    (no more than 200 words)
*   where appropriate, a small set of links
    to specific examples of their contributions
    (e.g., links to mailing list posts, pull requests, or workshops)

The minutes of award considerations will not name the individuals
concerned unless an award is made. The Executive Council will contact
proposers to keep them informed of the status of their proposals (such
as when the proposal will receive consideration).

### Past Awardees 

These awards were given under the aegis of the Software Carpentry Foundation and its then Steering Committee.

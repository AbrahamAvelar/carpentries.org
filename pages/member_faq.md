Here are answers to some frequently asked questions.  

## Memberships

1. **What are the standard membership packages you offer?**<br>
We offer Silver and Gold membership packages, each with an allotted number of seats in our Instructor Training program, and with an allotted number of workshops we will coordinate for you. We also offer Platinum plans, which we customize based on an individual institution’s needs.  Read more about the costs and benefits of each plan on our membership page.  

1. **What if those membership packages don’t fit my institution’s needs?**<br>
We’d be happy to talk with you to learn more about your institution’s goals and create a custom plan that works for you. However, this can take some time as we currently receive more inquiries than we have the staffing to address. Contact us at memberships@carpentries.org to learn more. 

1. **Do I need to renew my membership each year?**<br>
Yes, annual memberships expire one year from the date the agreement is signed.  Contact our Business team at finance@carpentries.org to learn more.

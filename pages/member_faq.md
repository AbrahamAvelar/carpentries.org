Here are answers to some frequently asked questions.  

## Memberships

1. **What are the standard membership packages you offer?**<br>
We offer Silver and Gold membership packages, each with an allotted number of seats in our [Instructor Training](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/) program, and with an allotted number of [workshops](/workshops) we will coordinate for you. We also offer Platinum plans, which we customize based on an individual institution’s needs.  Read more about the costs and benefits of each plan on our [membership](/membership) page.  

1. **What if those membership packages don’t fit my institution’s needs?**<br>
We’d be happy to talk with you to learn more about your institution’s goals and create a custom plan that works for you. However, this can take some time as we currently receive more inquiries than we have the staffing to address. Contact us at [memberships@carpentries.org](mailto:memberships@carpentries.org) to learn more. 

1. **Do I need to renew my membership each year?**<br>
Yes, annual memberships expire one year from the date the agreement is signed.  Contact our Business team at [finance@carpentries.org](mailto:finance@carpentries.org) to learn more.

## Technical Workshops

1. **How do your technical workshops run? Does this differ based on my membership package?**<br> 
Centrally organized workshops receive the same level of support under all circumstances.  The only difference based on membership level is the number of workshops organized for you.  Silver members receive four centrally-organized workshops; Gold members receive six. Workshops can cover curricula from any of our lesson programs: Data Carpentry, Library Carpentry, or Software Carpentry.  Contact us at team@carpentries.org to learn more about our workshop operations.<br><br>
Centrally organized workshops can also be purchased a-la-carte, or added to an existing membership at a discount determined by the membership level (see below) . If you would like to run a centrally-organized workshop in order to demonstrate the value of Carpentries Membership at your organisation, we will count the workshop fee paid at the time towards a  membership if purchased within the next calendar year.


1. **How soon after signing my membership can I get started with hosting technical workshops?**<br>
Right away! You can request technical workshops as soon as your membership agreement is in place by completing this form. To allow us time to recruit instructors and give them time to plan the workshop with you, we generally require 2-3 months lead time to schedule a workshop.  

1. **Can I run my own technical workshops without organizational support from The Carpentries?**<br>
Yes! Once you start building a team of trained and certified Instructors, you can work with them to run self-organized workshops. The Carpentries staff does not offer organizational support in running self-organized workshops, beyond providing survey links and tracking Instructor and Helper participation. Self-organized workshops do not count against the number of workshops included in your membership agreement.  There is no limit to the number of self-organized workshops you can run, regardless of your membership status.

1. **What happens if I want to run more centrally organized workshops than my agreement allows?**<br>
You are welcome to request more workshops. After you have completed your allotted workshops, any additional workshops are billed at a discount. Our current workshop fee schedule is here.

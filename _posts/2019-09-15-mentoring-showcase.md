### Have you ever been curious about what happens in a Carpentries mentoring group?

The instructor Development Committee will be hosting the first Mentoring Virtual Showcase for the 2019-2020 year on 
October 15, 2019 19:00 UTC. See presentations from the mentoring groups who met over the summer to get an idea of 
the possibilities!

This event is a low-pressure way to see if being a mentor or a mentee is right for you.

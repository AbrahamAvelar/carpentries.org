## Software Carpentry lessons in Japanese

As previously discussed we have a Japanese language team aiming to maintain a community led translation of the core Software Carpentry lesson. See our previous posts on [how we got started](https://carpentries.org/blog/2019/11/local-team-japan/) and [how we manage collaborative translations](https://carpentries.org/blog/2019/11/translations-in-japanese/) via GitHub. Our team has grown internationally in the age of online meetings with contributions from Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia, and the USA. We hope this will support growing the the Carpentries community in Japan and Carpentries lessons for Japanese learners overseas.

We are pleased to announce the complete lesson materials have been translated in Japanese for the “R for Reproducible Scientific Analysis” course (extras and other content is in progress). See the links below for a web version hosted on our GitHub organisation. This uses the “carpentries-i18n” theme for multilingual lessons.

The R lesson that we translated is archived so the English and Japanese content matches. We plan to use GitHub to merge updates to the lessons in English so that only new sections need to be translated. We hope that this system overcomes previous issues with maintaining translated lesson and are grateful to David Pérez-Suárez and the Spanish translation team for building the tools for this. We have expanded on this and provided further user guides (in English and Japanese) on GitHub if anyone wishes to use them. Release cycles of lesson materials have been raised as a way to aid maintaining multilingual lessons. Shell and Git lessons are in progress towards our goal of a complete Software Carpentry core lessons in Japanese.

We believe the R lessons are ready to share with the community. We welcome feedback from the community and sharing the lesson materials with Japanese learners. Contributions to improve the Japanese lessons are also encouraged. Inspired by the Spanish lessons, we would like to include these lessons on the Software Carpentry website once they are finished.

## Motivations for translation

We focused on the R lesson first because of growing demand to learn the R language in life science and data science. The Japanese translation team grew initially out of the Tokyo R community. The #TokyoR meetings (held mainly in Japanese) and their Slack workspace is primarily to share updates in the R community and aid new R users in Japanese. Many R novice learners in Japan are not so strong in their English skills so this community is hugely beneficial to introduce them to R and new packages that are typically announced in English. Similarly, there are more help forums and manuals available in English, although thanks to efforts of the Tokyo R community, resources are catching up in Japanese (including translation of books) and they share their expertise to new users.

We hope that the Japanese Software Carpentry lessons will be complementary to this. Building upon our momentum with the R lessons, we plan to translate Git and Shell as well so that Japanese (or bilingual) workshops are possible. At the moment Japan has very few trained instructors but we are hoping that some more can be trained in upcoming online instructor training in Australia timezones. We have also got some interest in Data Carpentry and Library Carpentry workshops in Japan. As the team grows, we hope that these will be faster as a community effort.

##  Expected benefits to the community

We make these lessons available freely online for the benefit of the Japanese community, including Japanese diaspora, around the world. They are now able to learn Software Carpentry materials in their native language. We believe this has immense benefits to share these lessons with people who may not be as confident speaking or learning in English.
This will also aid in giving workshops in Japan and getting support from organisations within Japan. Being able to run Japanese language or bilingual workshops will be beneficial to the community in Japan where English language skills are far from universal. It is also important for those involved in organisations to understand the course materials and goals of The Carpentries. Members of the Japanese team have made presentations on Software Carpentry in both English and Japanese as the community continues to grow.
We hope that this effort also inspires translations into other languages. We are indebted to the wider Carpentries community for developing the lesson materials in English and the Spanish Carpentries community for developing technical tools we use. We have developed and documented these tools to encourage new translators to join us. By making lesson materials available to non-English majority speaking countries and international students, we believe The Carpentries can have a far wider benefit to communities around the world.


## Getting Involved in the Japanese Community

We welcome any support to grow The Carpentries community in Japan and abroad in the Japanese language. We are not yet ready to 
host a full workshop but welcome visitors to Japan with open arms, bows, and “omotenashi” (Japanese hospitality). If you can 
contact us ahead of time, we can let you know if any meet-ups are planned for when you are planning to visit.

Support for the Japanese community from abroad is also welcome. Several of our team are based outside of the Kanto area, in 
other regions of Japan, the US, and New Zealand. While we have held meetings several times, we try to keep everyone updated 
online if they cannot attend due to their schedule or are unable to travel to Tokyo.

Any support for our efforts to translate the lessons into Japanese, maintain the translated lessons to keep them up-to-date, 
and to train instructors in Japan (or with Japanese language skills) will be appreciated. We hope to keep up our momentum to 
soon have an active community maintaining the lessons and using them with Japanese learners.

## What You Can Do To Help

See our posts on [how we got started](https://carpentries.org/blog/2019/11/local-team-japan/)
and [how we manage collaborative translations](https://carpentries.org/blog/2019/11/translations-in-japanese/).
In summary, you can contribute to Japanese lessons by submitting pull requests to
the PO files in this github repository: [https://github.com/swcarpentry_ja/i18n](https://github.com/swcarpentry-ja/i18n)

Changes to PO files are now merged into lesson automatically by GitHub Actions. We may share how
this works at a later date.

We are also interested in training instructors in Japan and holding workshops.
Please contact us if you are able to support this in any way.
We understand that this will be difficult with current restrictions
on travel and large gatherings.

## Find Out More

If you wish to get involved in the translations, please find us on Twitter, join us on Slack and send pull requests to our 
lessons on GitHub. Please note that some translations are ongoing already (check the issues tab for which are assigned).
We welcome help from anyone but English and Japanese skills are needed for many aspects. If you are fluent in Japanese,
please give us feedback on our translations. We are also happy to share how we manage translations with PO files on GitHub, 
please ask us if you have any questions about doing it in another language.

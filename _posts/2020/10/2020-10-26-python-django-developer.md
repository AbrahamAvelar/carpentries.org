AMY, the Infrastructure Team and the Workshop Administration Team, to improve
the existing code base and implement new features. AMY is built using Django and

jQuery, bootstrap, select2.

We seek an engaged and collaborative individual who shares our community values
for a temporary employee or contractor who will have the responsibility for
maintaining and developing new features to AMY.

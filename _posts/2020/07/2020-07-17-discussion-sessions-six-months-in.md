The [Carpentries Community Discussions](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/instructor_development/community_discussions.html?) are designed for everyone in The Carpentries community interested in learning, educating and advocating for teaching foundational coding and data science skills globally. Pre and Post-workshops discussions are designed for those getting ready to teach or having recently taught to come discuss their workshop with the community. Many Carpentry workshops globally are now hosted online due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this platform also allows instructors to share unique online teaching experiences to instructors in-training who join the call during their check-out process.

During the past six months the Community Discussion sessions have grown from strength to strength, not only have we automated the signup process for [Community Discussion Hosts](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/instructor_development/community_discussions.html?#who-can-host) with the use of Calendly and some magic from the Infrastructure Team, we [announced a new series of online workshop themed discussions](https://carpentries.org/blog/2020/05/online-workshop-themed-discussions/).

Below are some descriptive statistics of pre- and post-workshop

The infrastructure The Carpentries Team manages
is mostly invisible to its users,
and yet it provides critical services to our community members.

To name a few, we run our own [Etherpad](https://pad.carpentries.org) instance,
we have scripts that ensures that our websites display up-to-date information
about our [workshops]({% link pages/upcoming_workshops.html %}) and our [community members]({% link pages/instructors.html %}), and
we [generate reports]({% link _posts/2019/10/2019-10-21-transition-to-typeform.md %}) based on the results of the pre- and post-workshop surveys.

This year, our technical infrastructure has considerably changed.

We focused on abstracting the setup of our servers
by using technologies like [Docker](https://docker.com) and [Ansible](https://ansible.com),
and by automating some of our workflows to allow us to scale our operations.

To do so, we use a combination of R and Python scripts.
We rely on many open-source packages and libraries that allow us
to retrieve, aggregate, and visualize information across the different
services we use.

As we reflect on what we are grateful for at this end of this year,
we would like to extend our gratitude to all the developers of
open-source code that allow us to power our infrastructure.

Thank you all!
